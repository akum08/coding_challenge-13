# Coding Challenge 13 - www.fullstacktrends.com

We are trying something unique this month. Instead of everyone working on their own project, we are going to be working on one project together which we will put on www.producthunt.com at the end of the month and actually see how it does in the real world! 

The reason for doing this is to:
- Have a real life scenario of working on a project with other programmers
- Publish something you have helped create on producthunt
- Have a great story to tell about a project you have worked on during your interview
- Learn why working with teams is hard
- Give you experience working with others so that you can add it to your resume

## What is the Challenge?
For this project we are using a different github organisation, were we will be more selective on what is merged. This will give you a more realistic view on how opensource projects may be managed in a real world scenario.

So head on over to the project repo, located https://github.com/zeroDevs/coding_challenge-13/blob/master/README.md
